4. **Async/Await**: Proper handling of asynchronous operations
5. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly describe behavior
6. **Grouped Tests**: Related tests grouped with `test.describe()`
7. **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and setup
8. **Error Recovery**: Screenshots and traces on failure

## 🔐 Security Testing

- Input validation
- XSS prevention
- Data privacy (localStorage only)
- No external data leakage

## ♿ Accessibility Compliance

Tests ensure:
- Keyboard navigation works
- Screen readers supported
- ARIA labels present

2. Performance benchmarking
3. API mocking for offline tests
4. Test coverage reporting
5. Mutation testing
6. Load testing simulations
